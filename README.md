# Analyzing In-Office Salary Trends in AI, Data, and Machine Learning Roles

## Introduction

The AI, data, and machine learning industries are experiencing significant growth as more organizations
embrace data-driven strategies and automation. However, with a strong preference for in-office roles
within these fields, understanding compensation trends is critical to attract and retain skilled talent. This
project will analyze salary trends for in-office positions across AI, data, and machine learning roles,
focusing on variations by job title, experience level, company size, company location, and changes over
time from 2020 to 2024. With a majority of entries originating from the U.S., this analysis will explore
how U.S. salary trends align with or diverge from international patterns. Additionally, the dataset lacks
a primary key, resulting in duplicate entries that must be carefully managed to preserve data integrity.

## Business Impact

By examining in-office salary trends in these fast-growing fields, the analysis will provide companies
with benchmarks for competitive compensation strategies, aiding in talent acquisition and retention.
This data-driven approach will also benefit industry professionals, offering clear benchmarks that
support informed career decisions and negotiations. For policymakers and analysts, the findings can
illuminate regional disparities in salary and the relative competitiveness of the U.S. against other regions.

## Dataset(s)

This project uses a comprehensive dataset from [AIJobs.net](https://aijobs.net/), which provides salary information on AI,
data, and machine learning roles worldwide. The dataset includes details on job titles, experience levels,
employment types, remote work ratios, company locations, and company sizes. With over 59,000
records, this data offers a robust foundation for analyzing salary trends across various regions,
industries, and experience levels, with a focus on in-office roles. The dataset is published under the
CC0 license, allowing anyone to copy, modify, and distribute the work, even for commercial purposes,
without the need for permission.

## Tools Used
