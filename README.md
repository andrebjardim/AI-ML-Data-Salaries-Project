# Analyzing In-Office Salary Trends in AI, Data, and Machine Learning Roles

## Overview

As the demand for AI, data, and machine learning professionals grows, understanding compensation trends in these roles becomes crucial for employers, job seekers, and industry analysts. This project examines in-office salary patterns across AI, data, and machine learning roles to uncover trends based on job titles, experience levels, company size, and company location over time. By leveraging current salary datasets, I aim to address knowledge gaps in the industry regarding compensation in in-office roles, an area where comprehensive data is limited.

## Problem Statement

Despite the increasing popularity of remote work, a substantial portion of AI, data, and machine learning roles remain in-office. This analysis will focus on understanding salary trends for in-office positions, examining how factors like job title, experience level, company size, company location, and changes over time impact compensation. By highlighting these trends, I aim to provide insights valuable to companies designing competitive compensation packages and individuals seeking clarity on in-office salary expectations.

## Relevance

With in-office roles continuing to shape the workforce in AI and data fields, understanding the salary dynamics for these positions is crucial for talent acquisition and retention. Recent studies, such as LinkedIn's Workforce Report, indicate that in-office roles still play a dominant role in certain high-tech sectors, often offering differentiated salary structures compared to remote positions. The insights generated from this analysis could help businesses attract the right talent and assist professionals in making informed career choices within these industries.

## Dataset(s)

This project uses a comprehensive dataset from [AIJobs.net](https://aijobs.net/), which provides salary information on AI, data, and machine learning roles worldwide. The dataset includes details on job titles, experience levels, employment types, remote work ratios, company locations, and company sizes. With over 59,000 records, this data offers a robust foundation for analyzing salary trends across various regions, industries, and experience levels, with a focus on in-office roles.
