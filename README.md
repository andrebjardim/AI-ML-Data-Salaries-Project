![Dashboard](https://github.com/andrebjardim/AI-ML-Data-Salaries-Project/blob/main/Dashboard.png?raw=true)
## Introduction

The AI, data, and machine learning industries are experiencing significant growth as organizations increasingly embrace data-driven strategies and automation. Understanding compensation trends, particularly for in-office roles, is crucial for attracting and retaining top talent.

This project analyzes salary trends for in-office positions in these fields, focusing on:

- Variations by job title, experience level, company size, and location.
- Salary changes from 2020 to 2024.
- A primary focus on U.S. salary trends with a comparison to international patterns.

## Business Impact

This analysis delivers value by:

- **For Companies**: Providing benchmarks for competitive compensation strategies, aiding in talent acquisition and retention.
- **For Professionals**: Offering benchmarks to make informed career decisions and salary negotiations.
- **For Policymakers and Analysts**: Highlighting regional disparities and the U.S.'s competitiveness in global markets.

## Dataset(s)

This project utilizes data from [AIJobs.net](https://aijobs.net/), which contains over 59,000 records of salary information for AI, data, and machine learning roles worldwide. The dataset includes:

- Job titles
- Experience levels
- Employment types
- Remote work ratios
- Company locations and sizes
  
**License**: CC0 (open for copying, modifying, and distributing without permission).

**Note**: Duplicate entries due to the absence of a primary key were carefully managed to ensure data integrity.

## Analysis

Key findings include:

- **Experience Level**: Higher experience levels correlate with higher salaries, with greater variability at senior and executive levels.
- **Company Size**: Larger companies typically offer higher salaries; medium-sized companies show the greatest salary range.
- **Geographic Location**: The U.S. leads in average salary, followed by Canada and the U.K., which show lower but more consistent salaries.
- **Job Titles**: Specialized roles (e.g., ML Infrastructure Engineer, Head of Machine Learning) command higher salaries, while common roles (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Scientist) are more prevalent but have lower average salaries.

These insights empower organizations to optimize compensation strategies and individuals to align their career paths with market trends.

## Recommendations

- **For Future Studies**: Expand the dataset to include more diverse company locations, remote work roles, and additional job titles for a broader analysis.
- **For Companies**: Incorporate factors like company size, location, and specialization when designing competitive compensation packages.
- **For Professionals**: Focus on specialized roles to maximize earning potential.

## Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab**: Analysis, including SQL queries, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **SQL**: Data profiling for structure understanding, missing value identification, and quality assessment.
- **Python**: Data wrangling, statistical analysis, and handling duplicates.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards visualizing salary trends across various factors.
- **Google Slides**: Structured presentation of findings in a datafolio.
- **Microsoft Word**: Documentation and reporting, detailing methodology, results, and insights.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control, collaboration, and sharing the project with stakeholders and the broader data analytics community.
